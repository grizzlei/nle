 # todos
  - not so hard.
    - editor (code needs a mass refactor and cleanup)
    - gltf & glb loading
    - ~~scene saving and loading~~
    - point light
    - ~~mouse ray for 3d interaction~~
    - default shaders need tidying up
  - kind of hard
    - instanced drawing (that works with physics engine)
    - shadows
    - materials need more than specular
  - hard
    - collision system that does not suck
    - skeletal animation system
    - a game made with *nice little engine* that works
