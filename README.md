 # todos
  - not so hard.
    - editor
      - works, but the code needs to be sorted out
      - not sure if imgui_glfw class is needed, a whole new editor.cpp would be good
      - dynamic texture setting
    - gltf & glb loading
    - scene saving and loading (in progress)
    - point light
    - mouse ray for 3d interaction
    - default shaders need tidying up
  - kind of hard
    - instanced drawing (that works with physics engine)
    - shadows
    - materials need more than specular
  - hard
    - collision system that does not suck
    - skeletal animation system
    - a game made with nice little engine that works
